                My journey into web development started during college when I built my first website using HTML and CSS.
                What began as a simple curiosity quickly turned into a passion as I discovered the power of creating
                interactive experiences on the web.

                After graduating with a Computer Science degree, I dove headfirst into the world of JavaScript and
                modern web frameworks. I was fascinated by how React could make complex user interfaces feel intuitive
                and responsive. This led me to specialize in full-stack development, learning Node.js and various
                databases to build complete web applications.

              <p>
                Over the years, I&apos;ve had the privilege of working with startups and established companies, helping them
                bring their digital visions to life. Each project has taught me something new, whether it&apos;s a
                cutting-edge technology, a better way to solve problems, or the importance of user-centered design.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, I&apos;m passionate about sharing my knowledge through writing and open source contributions. I
                believe that the best way to grow as a developer is to help others learn and succeed. When I&apos;m not
                coding, you&apos;ll find me exploring new technologies, reading about industry trends, or working on side
                projects that push my skills to new limits.
