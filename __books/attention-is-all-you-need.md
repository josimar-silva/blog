The paper that launched a thousand LLMs. Reading this after working with transformer-based models for a while gave me a much deeper appreciation for the elegance of the attention mechanism. The authors' insight that recurrence and convolution are unnecessary for sequence modeling was revolutionary. The mathematical formulation is surprisingly accessible, and the experimental results speak for themselves.
