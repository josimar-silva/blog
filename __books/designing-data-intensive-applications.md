An exceptional deep dive into the fundamentals of distributed systems and data architecture. Kleppmann masterfully explains complex concepts like consistency, partitioning, and replication with clear examples and real-world case studies. This is my second time reading it, and I discovered new insights about CAP theorem and eventual consistency patterns. Essential reading for any backend engineer working with distributed systems.
