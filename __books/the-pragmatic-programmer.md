A timeless classic that holds up remarkably well despite being written over 20 years ago. The principles of DRY, orthogonality, and 'programming by coincidence' are as relevant today as ever. Some sections feel dated (the tools discussion), but the core philosophy of craftsmanship and continuous learning resonates strongly. The updated 20th anniversary edition addresses some modern concerns but maintains the original's practical wisdom.
