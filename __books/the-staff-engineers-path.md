After being promoted to Staff Engineer, I faced the question: "Now what?"
Facing multiple questions about what it means to be a Staff Engineer, I started searching for literature on the topic that would help shape and improve my effectiveness in this role.
This book was a treasure in helping me perform my best.

Here are some key things to keep in mind if you find yourself in the same position:

#### Staff Engineer Role

At the time when I became Staff Engineer, I had only one other peer who held the same position.
I found myself grappling with doubt, wondering "Am I doing this correctly?" and "Should I be more like my peer?"

From the get-go, this book makes it clear that this is a common question among Staff+ Engineers and there's no hard-defined shape for Staff+ Engineer roles.

> Staff engineering roles are ambiguous by definition. It's up to you to discover and decide what your role is and what it means for you. [pg. 30]

For me, this meant leveraging my skills to unblock teams, foster growth, and fill the technical gaps on a team while imparting them with long-term knowledge.

#### You're a Role Model Now (Sorry)

Here's a daunting thought: as soon as you get the Staff+ role, [you become a role model](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-staff-engineers-path).
While scary, this reality also sets the expectations of the role.
Leading by example becomes essential.

#### Context Matters: Respect What Came Before

Avoid the trap of pointing fingers at projects that were built before you arrived.
Understand the context around the decisions that were made at the time and
connect them to current business needs and how they can help scale the technical solution further.

#### Be a Force Multiplier

Staff+ roles are, in essence, leadership roles. The goal is to empower people around you to grow. At the end of the day, you should not be a bottleneck but a force multiplier that speeds teams up.
#### Conclusion

For any fellow engineer out there still figuring out what it means to be in a Staff+ position, I could not recommend this book enough.

It contains a myriad of helpful information on how to be effective and ensure you leverage your skills to impact the engineering culture of your company. Reilly's practical frameworks, from the "three maps" for navigating organizational complexity to specific guidance on project leadership and scaling influence, provide actionable strategies that can help you be an effective technical leader.

The book earned its five-star rating by combining real-world scenarios, honest discussions about the challenges of the role, and concrete, actionable advice. Whether you're newly promoted or have been in a Staff+ role for years, this book offers valuable insights for increasing your effectiveness.
