The third edition of Rinha de Backend presented another fascinating opportunity to dive deep into backend architecture and performance optimization. This time around, I chose Rust as my weapon of choice, partly inspired by recent conversations about the language and partly driven by curiosity about how modern AI tools could assist in the development process.

## Why Rust?

The decision to use Rust wasn't made in isolation. It came on the heels of attending a Rust meetup where the language's performance characteristics and memory safety guarantees were discussed at length. For a backend challenge that emphasizes performance and reliability, Rust seemed like a natural fit.

Rust's zero-cost abstractions and fearless concurrency model make it particularly well-suited for high-performance backend services. The language forces you to think carefully about memory management and concurrent access patterns—exactly the kind of considerations that matter in a performance-focused challenge like Rinha de Backend.

## Working with Gemini CLI: A Double-Edged Sword

### LLMs as Power Tools

A few months ago, Elder Moraes provided our community with an incredible opportunity to speak with Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) as part of the Confraria Dev. During that conversation, someone asked about the role of AI in software development, and Uncle Bob's response has stuck with me ever since:

> "LLMs are power tools. Understand how it works, use it, don't trust it."

This analogy perfectly captures the relationship developers should have with AI assistance. Just like a power saw can help you build furniture faster but can also cause serious injury if misused, LLMs can accelerate development while potentially introducing subtle bugs or architectural issues if you're not careful.

The key insight here is that LLMs work best when you're already competent in what you're trying to build. They can help you write boilerplate, suggest optimizations, and even debug issues, but they can't replace fundamental understanding of software engineering principles.

### Staying in the Driver's Seat

Throughout the Rinha de Backend project, I made sure to maintain control over the architectural decisions and overall direction. The AI was there to assist with implementation details, suggest Rust idioms I might not be familiar with, and help debug compilation errors, but the core design decisions remained mine.

This approach proved invaluable. While Gemini CLI could quickly generate code snippets and explain Rust concepts, I was the one deciding how to structure the application, which crates to use, and how to handle the specific performance requirements of the challenge.

### The Stubbornness Factor

One of the most frustrating aspects of working with LLMs is their occasional stubbornness. There were moments when Gemini would insist on a particular approach that I knew wasn't optimal for the specific use case. Sometimes it would completely disregard context from previous conversations or ignore specific requirements I had outlined.

This reinforces Uncle Bob's advice about not trusting AI blindly. The tool is incredibly powerful, but it's not infallible. You need to be prepared to push back, provide additional context, or simply ignore suggestions that don't align with your understanding of the problem.

### Source Control is Non-Negotiable

Working with AI assistance makes proper version control even more critical than usual. When you're rapidly iterating and experimenting with AI-generated code, atomic commits become your safety net. Each logical change should be committed separately, allowing you to easily revert problematic modifications without losing other progress.

I found myself making more frequent, smaller commits than usual during this project. This practice proved invaluable when I needed to backtrack from an AI suggestion that initially seemed promising but turned out to cause performance regressions.

### Mind Your Wallet

One practical consideration that's easy to overlook: AI assistance isn't free, and costs can add up quickly during intensive development sessions. Unlike traditional development tools that you pay for once, LLM usage is typically metered, which means you need to be mindful of how you're using the tool.

This constraint actually improved my development process. Instead of asking the AI to generate large blocks of code, I learned to ask more targeted questions and use the tool more strategically. This led to better understanding and more intentional code.

## Observations on Rinha de Backend's Third Edition

What continues to fascinate me about Rinha de Backend is the diversity of approaches that emerge from the community. Despite having the same performance requirements and constraints, engineers from different backgrounds and experience levels come up with remarkably varied solutions.

This edition saw everything from traditional Java Spring Boot applications to cutting-edge Rust services, from simple monolithic architectures to complex micro-service deployments. Each approach represents a different set of trade-offs and priorities, reflecting the rich ecosystem of backend development in 2025.

The challenge serves as a beautiful reminder that there's rarely a single "correct" solution to complex engineering problems. Context, team expertise, operational requirements, and personal preferences all play roles in determining the best approach for any given situation.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement

LLMs can significantly accelerate development, but they work best when you already understand what you're trying to build. Use them to handle boilerplate, explore unfamiliar APIs, and debug issues, but don't let them make architectural decisions for you.

### 2. Maintain Skepticism

Always validate AI-generated code. Test it thoroughly, understand what it does, and don't hesitate to rewrite it if it doesn't meet your standards or requirements.

### 3. Version Control Everything

When working with AI assistance, make frequent, atomic commits. This gives you the flexibility to experiment while maintaining the ability to quickly revert problematic changes.

### 4. Choose Your Battles

Not every problem needs AI assistance. Sometimes it's faster and more educational to solve things yourself, especially for concepts you're trying to learn deeply.

## Conclusion

The combination of Rust's performance characteristics and AI-assisted development created an interesting dynamic for this year's Rinha de Backend challenge. While the AI helped me navigate Rust's learning curve more quickly than I could have alone, the real value came from understanding when to use the tool and when to rely on fundamental engineering principles.

As we continue to integrate AI tools into our development workflows, the most successful developers will be those who can effectively leverage these tools while maintaining their critical thinking skills and deep understanding of software engineering fundamentals.

The future of software development isn't about AI replacing developers—it's about developers becoming more effective by thoughtfully incorporating AI into their toolkit. Just remember: you're still in the driver's seat.
